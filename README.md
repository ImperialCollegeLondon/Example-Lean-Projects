# Some examples of Lean projects for mathematicians

If you download this Lean project onto your own computer using `leanproject`
by typing `leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/Lean-UROP` (or whatever
I end up calling it on GitHub),
you will just be able to edit it and experiment with it. It's lots of half-written Lean projects, some big, some small, all in their own directories.

# Other projects like this

There are other projects which are readable and have
half-written code and opportunities to fill in proofs of theorems. Here
are some examples:

* [The complex number game](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/complex-number-game).

`leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/complex-number-game`

* [Some commutative algebra experiments](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/M4P33/blob/1a179372db71ad6802d11eacbc1f02f327d55f8f/src/for_mathlib/commutative_algebra/Zariski_lemma.lean#L80-L81)

`leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/M4P33`

* [Building group theory from scratch](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/group-theory-game)

`leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/group-theory-game`

* [Galois theory experiments](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/P11-Galois-Theory)

`leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/P11-Galois-Theory`

* [Basics of Clausen/Scholze theory of condensed sets](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/condensed-sets)

`leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/condensed-sets`
